The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides architectural best practices across the six pillars for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems in the cloud. The Framework provides a set of questions that allows you to review an existing or proposed architecture. It also provides a set of AWS best practices for each pillar. Using the Framework in your architecture will help you produce stable and efficient systems, which allow you to focus on your functional requirements.
