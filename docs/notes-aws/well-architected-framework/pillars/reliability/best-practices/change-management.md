The following questions focus on these considerations for reliability.

??? question "How do you monitor workload resources?"
    
    Logs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring enables your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.

??? question "How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in demand?"
    
    A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in time.

??? question "How do you implement change?"
    
    Controlled changes are necessary to deploy new functionality, and to ensure that the workloads and the operating environment are running known software and can be patched or replaced in a predictable manner. If these changes are uncontrolled, then it makes it difficult to predict the effect of these changes, or to address issues that arise because of them.
