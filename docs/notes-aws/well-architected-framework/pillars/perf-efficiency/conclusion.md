Achieving and maintaining performance efficiency requires a data-driven approach. You should actively consider access patterns and trade-offs that will allow you to optimize for higher performance. Using a review process based on benchmarks and load tests allows you to select the appropriate resource types and configurations. Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to rapidly and safely evolve your architecture, while you use data to make fact-based decisions about your architecture. Putting in place a combination of active and passive monitoring ensures that the performance of your architecture does not degrade over time.
