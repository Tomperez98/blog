The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

??? question "How do you select your database solution?"

    The optimal database solution for a system varies based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability. Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.

The optimal database solution for a system varies based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability. Many systems use different database solutions for various sub-systems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.

Understand the different characteristics of data in your workload. Determine if the workload requires transactions, how it interacts with data, and what its performance demands are. Use this data to select the best performing database approach for your workload (for example, relational databases, NoSQL Key-value, document, wide column, graph, time series, or in-memory storage).

- **Relational databases** store data with predefined schemas and relationships between them. These databases are designed to support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions, and maintain referential integrity and strong data consistency. **Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS**
- **Key-value databases** are optimized for common access patterns, typically to store and retrieve large volumes of data. These databases deliver quick response times, even in extreme volumes of concurrent requests. **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **In-memory databases** are used for applications that require real-time access to data. By storing data directly in memory, these databases deliver microsecond latency to applications for whom millisecond latency is not enough. You may use in-memory databases for application caching, session management, gaming leaderboards, and geospatial applications. **Amazon ElasticCache**
- **A document database** is designed to store semi structured data as JSON-like documents. These databases help developers build and update applications such as content management, catalogs, and user profiles quickly. **Amazon DocumentDB**
- **A wide column store is a type of NoSQL database.** It uses tables, rows, and columns, but unlike a relational database, the names and format of the columns can vary from row to row in the same table. **Amazon Keyspaces**
- **Graph databases** are for applications that must navigate and query millions of relationships between highly connected graph datasets with millisecond latency at large scale. Many companies use graph databases for fraud detection, social networking, and recommendation engines. **Amazon Neptune**
- **Time-series databases** efficiently collect, synthesize, and derive insights from data that changes over time. IoT applications, DevOps, and industrial telemetry can utilize time-series databases. **Amazon Timestream**
- **Ledger databases** provide a centralized and trusted authority to maintain a scalable, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable record of transactions for every application. We see ledger databases used for systems of record, supply chain, registrations, and even banking transactions. **Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)**
