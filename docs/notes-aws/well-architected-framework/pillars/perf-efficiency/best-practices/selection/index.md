# Selection

The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

??? question "How do you select the best performing architecture?"

    Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.

## Performance Architecture Selection
Often, multiple approaches are required to get optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance. Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution. 

Your architecture will likely combine a number of different architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss the four main resource types to consider ([compute](compute.md), [storage](storage.md), [database](database.md), and [network](network.md)).
