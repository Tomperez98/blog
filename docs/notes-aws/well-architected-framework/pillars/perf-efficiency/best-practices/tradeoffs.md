The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

??? question "How do you use tradeoffs to improve performance?"

    When architecting solutions, determining tradeoffs enables you to select an optimal approach. Often you can improve performance by trading consistency, durability, and space for time and latency.

## Using Trade-offs to Improve Performance
When architecting solutions, actively considering trade-offs enables you to select an optimal approach. Often you can improve performance by trading consistency, durability, and space for time and latency. Trade-offs can increase the complexity of your architecture and require load testing to ensure that a measurable benefit is obtained.

- **Understand the areas where performance is most critical:** Understand and identify areas where increasing the performance of your workload will have a positive impact on efficiency or customer experience. For example, a website that has a large amount of customer interaction can benefit from using edge services to move content delivery closer to customers.
- **Learn about design patterns and services:** Research and understand the various design patterns and services that help improve workload performance. As part of the analysis, identify what you could trade to achieve higher performance.
- **Identify how trade-offs impact customers and efficiency:** When evaluating performance-related improvements, determine which choices will impact your customers and workload efficiency.
- **Measure the impact of performance improvements:** As changes are made to improve performance, evaluate the collected metrics and data. Use this information to determine impact that the performance improvement had on the workload, the workloadâ€™s components, and your customers. This measurement helps you understand the improvements that result from the tradeoff, and helps you determine if any negative side-effects were introduced.
- **Use various performance-related strategies:** Where applicable, utilize multiple strategies to improve performance.
