The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

??? question "How do you monitor your resources to ensure they are performing?"

    System performance can degrade over time. Monitor system performance to identify degradation and remediate internal or external factors, such as the operating system or application load.

## Monitor Your Resources to Ensure That They Are Performing as Expected
System performance can degrade over time. Monitor system performance to identify degradation and remediate internal or external factors, such as the operating system or application load.

- **Record performance-related metrics:** Use a monitoring and observability service to record performance-related metrics.
- **Analyze metrics when events or incidents occur:** In response to (or during) an event or incident, use monitoring dashboards or reports to understand and diagnose the impact. These views provide insight into which portions of the workload are not performing as expected.
- **Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure workload performance:** Identify the KPIs that indicate whether the workload is performing as intended.
- **Use monitoring to generate alarm-based notifications:** Using the performance-related key performance indicators (KPIs) that you defined, use a monitoring system that generates alarms automatically when these measurements are outside expected boundaries.
- **Monitor and alarm proactively:** Use key performance indicators (KPIs), combined with monitoring and alerting systems, to proactively address performance-related issues.
