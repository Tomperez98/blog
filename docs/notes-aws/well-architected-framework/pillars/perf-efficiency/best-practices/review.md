The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

??? question "How do you evolve your workload to take advantage of new releases?"

    When architecting workloads, there are finite options that you can choose from. However, over time, new technologies and approaches become available that could improve the performance of your workload.

## Evolve Your Workload to Take Advantage of New Releases
Take advantage of the continual innovation at AWS driven by customer need. We release new Regions, edge locations, services, and features regularly. Any of these releases could positively improve the performance efficiency of your architecture.

- **Stay up-to-date on new resources and services**
- **Define a process to improve workload performance**
- **Evolve workload performance over time**

Use the information you gather when evaluating new services or technologies to drive change. As your business or workload changes, performance needs also change. Use data gathered from your workload metrics to evaluate areas where you can get the biggest gains in efficiency or performance, and proactively adopt new services and technologies to keep up with demand.
