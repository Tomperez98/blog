The following question focuses on these considerations for security.

??? question "How do you detect and investigate security events?"

    Capture and analyze events from logs and metrics to gain visibility. Take action on security events and potential threats to help secure your workload.
    
## Configure
A foundational practice is to establish a set of detection mechanisms at the account level. This base set of mechanisms is aimed at recording and detecting a wide range of actions on all resources in your account. They allow you to build out a comprehensive detective capability with options that include automated remediation, and partner integrations to add functionality.

## Investigate
For each detective mechanism you have, you should also have a process, in the form of a runbook or playbook, to investigate.
