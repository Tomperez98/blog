Operational excellence is an ongoing and iterative effort.

Set up your organization for success by having shared goals. Ensure that everyone understands their part in achieving business outcomes and how they impact the ability of others to succeed. Provide support for your team members so that they can support your business outcomes.

Every operational event and failure should be treated as an opportunity to improve the operations of your architecture. By understanding the needs of your workloads, predefining runbooks for routing activities, and playbooks to guide issue resolutions, using the operations as code features in AWS, and maintaining situational awereness, your operations will be better prepared and able to respond more effectively when incidents occur.

Through focusing on incremental improvement based on priorities as they change, and lessons learned from event response and retrospective analysis, you will enable the success of your business by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of your activities.
