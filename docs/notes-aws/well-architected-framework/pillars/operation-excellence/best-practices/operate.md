## Understanding Workload Health
Define, capture, and analyze workload metrics to gain visibility to workload events so that you can take appropriate action.

**Your team should be able to understand the health of your worklaod easily.** You'll want to use metrics based on workload outcomes to gain useful insights.

## Responding to Events
You should anticipate operational events, both planned (for example, sales promotion, deployments, and failure tests) and unplanned (for example, surges in utilization and component failures). You should use your existing runbooks and playbooks to deliver consistent results when you respond to alerts. Defined alerts should be owned by a role or a team that is accountable for the reponse and escalations. You will also want to know the business impact of your system components and use this to target efforts when needed. You should perform a root cause analysis (RCA) after events, and then prevent recurrence of failures or document workarounds.
