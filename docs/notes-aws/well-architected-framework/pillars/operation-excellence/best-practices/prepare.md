The following questions focus on these considerations for operational excellence.

??? question "How do you design your workload so that you can understand its state?"

    Design your workload so that it provides the information necessary across all components (for example, metrics, logs, and traces) for you to understand its internal state. This enables you to provide effective responses when appropriate.

??? question "How do you reduce defects, ease remediation, and improve flow into production?"

    Adopt approaches that improve flow of changes into production, that enable refactoring, fast feedback on quality, and bug fixing. These accelerate beneficial changes entering production, limit issues deployed, and enable rapid identification and remediation of issues introduced through deployment activities.

??? question "How do you mitigate deployment risks?"

    Adopt approaches that provide fast feedback on quality and enable rapid recovery from changes that do not have desired outcomes. Using these practices mitigates the impact of issues introduced through the deployment of changes.

??? question "How do you know that you are ready to support a workload?"

    Evaluate the operational readiness of your workload, processes and procedures, and personnel to understand the operational risks related to your workload.
