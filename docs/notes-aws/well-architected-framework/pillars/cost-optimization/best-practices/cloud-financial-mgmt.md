The following question focuses on these considerations for cost optimization.

??? question "How do you implement cloud financial management?"

    Implementing Cloud Financial Management enables organizations to realize business value and financial success as they optimize their cost and usage and scale on AWS.

## Functional Ownership
**Establish a cost optmization function** responsible for establishing and maintaining a culture of cost awareness. It can be an existing individual, or a team within your organization.

The function (individual or team) prioritizes and spends the required percentage of their time on cost management and cost optimization activities. The function requires a multi-disciplined approach, with capabilities in project management, data science, financial analysis, and software/infrastructure development. The function may be measured against their ability to execute and deliver against cost optimization goals (for example, workload efficiency metrics).


## Finance and Technology Partnership
Establish a partnership between key finance and technology stakeholders to create a shared understanding of organizational goals and develop mechanisms to succeed financially in the variable spend model of cloud computing.

The partnership of finance and technology provides the following benefits:
1. Finance and technology teams have near real-time visibility into cost and usage.
2. Finance and technology teams establish a standard operating procedure to handle cloud spend variance.
3. Finance stakeholders act as strategic advisors with respect to how capital is used to purchase commitment discounts (for example, Reserved Instances or AWS Savings Plans), and how the cloud is used to grow the organization.
4. Existing accounts payable and procurement processes are used with the cloud.
5. Finance and technology teams collaborate on forecasting future AWS cost and usage to align/build organizational budgets.
6. Better cross-organizational communication through a shared language, and common understanding of financial concepts.

## Cloud Budgets and Forecasts
Customers use the cloud for efficiency, speed and agility, which creates a highly variable amount of cost and usage. Costs can decrease with increases in workload efficiency, or as new workloads and features are deployed. Or, workloads will scale to serve more of your customers, which increases cloud usage and costs. Existing organizational budgeting processes must be modified to incorporate this variability.

Adjust existing budgeting and forecasting processes to become more dynamic using either a trend-based algorithm (using historical costs as inputs), or using business driver based algorithms (for example, new product launches or regional expansion), or a combination of both trend and business drivers.

## Cost-Aware Processes
Cost awareness must be implemented in new and existing organizational processes. It is recommended to re-use and modify existing processes where possible—this minimizes the impact to agility and velocity. The following recommendations will help implement cost awareness in your workload:

- Ensure that change management includes a cost measurement to quantify the financial impact of your changes. This helps pro-actively address cost-related concerns and highlight cost savings.
- Ensure that cost optimization is a core component of your operating capabilities. For example, you can leverage existing incident management processes to investigate and identify root cause for cost and usage anomalies (cost overages).
- Accelerate cost savings and business value realization through automation or tooling. When thinking about the cost of implementing, frame the conversation to include an ROI component to justify the investment of time or money.
- Extend existing training and development programs to include cost aware training throughout your organization. It is recommended that this includes continuous training and certification. This will build an organization that is capable of self-managing cost and usage.

## Cost-Aware Culture
Implement changes or programs across your organization to create a cost aware culture. It is recommended to start small, then as your capabilities increase and your organization’s use of the cloud increases, implement large and wide ranging programs.

A cost aware culture allows you to scale cost optimization and cloud financial management through best practices that are performed in an organic and decentralized manner across your organization. This creates high levels of capability across your organization with minimal effort, compared to a strict top-down, centralized approach.

## Quantify Business Value Delivered Through Cost Optimization
In addition to reporting savings from cost optimization, it is recommended that you quantify the additional value delivered. Cost optimization benefits are typically quantified in terms of lower costs per business outcome. For example, you can quantify On-Demand Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) cost savings when you purchase Savings Plans, which reduce cost and maintain workload output levels.

Quantifying business value from cost optimization allows you to understand the entire set of benefits to your organization. Because cost optimization is a necessary investment, quantifying business value allows you to explain the return on investment to stakeholders. Quantifying business value can help you gain more buy-in from stakeholders on future cost optimization investments, and provides a framework to measure the outcomes for your organization’s cost optimization activities.
