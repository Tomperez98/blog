## **The review of architectures need**
- To be done in a consistent manner, with a blamefree approach that encourages diving deep.
- To be a light weight process (hours no days) that is a conversation **not an audit**.
- To aim identify any critical issues that need to be addressed or areas that could be improved.
- To conclude with a set of actions that should improve the experience of a customer using the workload.

AWS recommends that the team members who build an architecture use the Well-Architected Framework to continually review their architecture, rathen than holding a formal review meeting. **A continuous approach allows your team members to update answers as the architecture evolves, and improve the architecture as you deliver features**.

> The AWS Well-Architecture Framework is aligned to the way that AWS reviews systems and services internally. It is premised on a set of design principles that influences architectural approach, and questions that ensure people don't neglect areas that often featured in Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Whenever there's a significan issue with the internal system, AWS service, or customer, we look at the RCA to see if we could improve the review processes we use.

**After you have done a review, you should have a list of issues that you can prioritize based on your business context.** You'll also want to take into account the impact of those issues on the day-to-day work of your team. If you address these issues early, you could free up time to work on creating business value rather than solving recurring problems. As you address issues, you can update your review to see how the architecture is improving.
