The following question focuses on these considerations for sustainability.

<details>
<summary>How do you take advantage of user behavior patterns to support your sustainability goals?</summary>
<p>
The way users consume your workloads and other resources can help you identify improvements to meet sustainability goals. Scale infrastructure to continually match user load and ensure that only the minimum resources required to support users are deployed. Align service levels to customer needs. Position resources to limit the network required for users to consume them. Remove existing, unused assets. Identify created assets that are unused and stop generating them. Provide your team members with devices that support their needs with minimized sustainability impact.
