The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

<details>
<summary>How do you select the best performing architecture?</summary>
<p>
Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.
</p>
</details>

### Compute

<details>
<summary>How do you select your compute solution?</summary>
<p>
The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.
</p>
</details>

### Storage

<details>
<summary>How do you select your storage solution?</summary>
<p>
The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.
</p>
</details>

### Database

<details>
<summary>How do you select your database solution?</summary>
<p>
The optimal database solution for a system varies based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability. Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.
</p>
</details>

### Network

<details>
<summary>How do you configure your networking solution?</summary>
<p>
The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.
