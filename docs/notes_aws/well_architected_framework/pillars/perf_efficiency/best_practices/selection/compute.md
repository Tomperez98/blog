The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.

<details>
<summary>How do you select your compute solution?</summary>
<p>
The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.
