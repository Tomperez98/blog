The Security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security.

## **Definition**
There are six best practice areas for security in the cloud:

- Security
- Identity and Access Management
- Detection
- Infrastructure Protection
- Data Protection
- Incident Response

Before you architect any workload, you need to put in place practices that influence security. ***You will want to control who can do what***. In addition you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents.
